# ShellyMQTT
![ShellyMQTT Test Suite](https://github.com/AaronLionsheep/ShellyMQTT/workflows/ShellyMQTT%20Test%20Suite/badge.svg?branch=master)

An IndigoDomo plugin that uses the [MQTTConnector Plugin](https://github.com/FlyingDiver/Indigo-MQTT) to interface with Shelly devices in Indigo. Each Shelly device is represented in Indigo using a single device.

The MQTT protocol is used to provide fast communication to and from the individual devices.
